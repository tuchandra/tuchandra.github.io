      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/site_comparison.html&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I compared the features of my old and new site. This is part 2 of that post, focusing on things that I missed then that have only come up after a few weeks of using the site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good software engineering is an indispensible part of good data science. I&amp;rsquo;ve believed this for a while, but only recently come to feel strongly about it, and this post goes into more detail on why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] &#39;This Post Will Just Get Taken Down&#39;: Characterizing Removed Pro-Eating Disorder Content on Social Media</title>
      <link>/papers/removed_pro_ed_chancellor.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/removed_pro_ed_chancellor.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a social computing paper analyzing characteristics of over 30,000 pro-eating disorder (pro-ED) posts that were removed from Instagram after having been public at one time. The authors built a classifier for removed pro-ED posts against non-removed ones, and also studied the characteristics of removed posts more generally. Published in CHI 2016.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>/papers/competition_crowd_out_simonov.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/competition_crowd_out_simonov.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another paper on digital search advertising, this one on the effects of competition on ads placed on brand keyword searches. This was another study reacting to the eBay study on own-brand advertising.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Firms&#39; Reactions to Public Information on Business Practices: Case of Search Advertising</title>

      <guid>/papers/reactions_to_search_ads_rao.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a paper evaluating the effects of the infamous eBay online advertising experiment, in which eBay pulled millions of dollars of own-brand advertising and saw no measurable effect on web traffic. The study (using data from Bing) evaluated how other companies reacted to this news.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, Hugo! This post marks the first one written specifically for the new version of my site, built with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline some of the reasons for switching to Hugo and talk about the process of moving everything over.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/reading/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a page of things I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to read &amp;ldquo;soon&amp;rdquo; (for some value of soon). It&amp;rsquo;s some cross between a digital bookshelf and public bookmarks, where I drop papers that cross my radar or blog posts, talks, or other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these I&amp;rsquo;ve printed out and carry around with me. Others are unlikely to ever be read because they&amp;rsquo;re so far out of my areas of expertise or interest. While this page is mostly for my own reference, it also pretty broadly shows the types of work I&amp;rsquo;m interested in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Discrimination in the Age of Algorithms (2/2)</title>
      <link>/papers/discrimination_algorithms_kleinberg_2.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/discrimination_algorithms_kleinberg_2.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do we regulate algorithms? How can they help us to create equity? This is part 2 of my summary of the paper by Kleinberg et al.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Discrimination in the Age of Algorithms (1/2)</title>
      <link>/papers/discrimination_algorithms_kleinberg_1.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/discrimination_algorithms_kleinberg_1.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do algorithms affect discrimination, in the legal sense of the word? Naively, one might say that algorithms must be regulated and heavily scrutinized to avoid computers encoding human biases. This paper studies not only that, but also the opposite idea: that they can be positive forces for good. (Part 1 of 2.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is a reflection on two articles, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/viral-app-labels-you-isnt-what-you-think/&#34;&gt;The viral app that labels you isn&amp;rsquo;t quite what you think&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/ai-biased-how-scientists-trying-fix/&#34;&gt;AI is biased. Here&amp;rsquo;s how scientists are trying to fix it&lt;/a&gt;, both from Wired.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Me, My Echo Chamber, and I: Introspection on Social Media Polarization</title>
      <link>/papers/introspection_echo_chamber_gillani.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/introspection_echo_chamber_gillani.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s well-known that &amp;ldquo;echo chambers&amp;rdquo; exist online, but to what extent are people aware of them? This paper studies that question by introducing an application to visualize how politically active and polarized users&amp;rsquo; Twitter networks are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
