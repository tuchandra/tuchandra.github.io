      <description>&lt;p&gt;How did the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic affect expressions of mental health on Twitter? This paper investigates. Through comparisons between 2020 and 2019, and clinically validated machine learning classifiers, the authors study changes in language on social media.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study, from the NeurIPS &lt;a href=&#34;https://nbiair.com/&#34;&gt;Navigating the Broader Impacts of AI Research workshop&lt;/a&gt;, is a field experiment in algorithmic bias. Take 400 programmers and ask them to predict math performance; in what ways are their algorithms biased?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another book that I&amp;rsquo;ve read over the past couple of weeks was Matthew Walker&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Why We Sleep.&lt;/em&gt; Walker distilled perhaps the most complex biological phenomenon into an accessible 300 pages, and he taught me a lot about this essential process. (Update: maybe not!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/books/how_to_do_nothing.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Do Nothing&lt;/em&gt; is perhaps the best book I read this year. Written as a series of loosely linked essays about finding your place in the world, Jenny Odell&amp;rsquo;s writing conveyed how deeply personal this journey is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s reading features the cycle of content moderation controversies (from a wonderful article titled &amp;ldquo;What Pornhub and Peloton have in common with Facebook&amp;rdquo;), along with thoughts on language servers and static site generators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On quirks in Ruby, leaving code better than you found it, VS Code shortcuts, and graph neural networks. Happy Thanksgiving, for those in the US!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/posts/covid_illinois.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 situation in Illinois is dire. The media doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be talking about it, even though the situation is presently worse here than it was in many places over the summer. What gives?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My review of Nir Eyal&#39;s Hooked</title>

      <guid>/books/hooked.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I review Nir Eyal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Hooked&lt;/em&gt;, a 200-page manual for creating habit-forming products. It&amp;rsquo;s clear that his steps work&amp;mdash;examples from several common products readily support them. But I question whether this is being used for good or evil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory as Sociotechnical Foresight in Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>/papers/decolonial_ai_mohamed.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/decolonial_ai_mohamed.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that AI can be harmful, but discussions of AI harm often miss historical context. This paper explores the role of decolonial theories in AI to address this gap.  Through ethical foresight, the authors argue, we can rethink the role of AI in helping and harming people of different societies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] The Complementary Nature of Perceived and Actual Time Spent Online in Measuring Digital Well-being</title>
      <link>/papers/complementary_nature_time_online_mok.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/complementary_nature_time_online_mok.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Self-reported measures of time spent online are known to be inaccurate compared to objective, server-log-informed measures. And while they&amp;rsquo;re each individually useful in predicting problematic effects online, little is known about how these two measures can be used alongside each other. This CSCW paper uses the open-source, open-data platform Lichess to study this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/data_and_power_archival_schoenebeck.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another CSCW paper for this week&amp;rsquo;s reading group; this one on digital archives. What does data preservation mean in a digital world? How do adults see their legacy? This paper draws on archival theory to study these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/automated_content_moderation_karahalios.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When algorithms make decisions, humans should be able to appeal them. Right? This CSCW paper studies users&amp;rsquo; experience with contesting algorithmic content moderation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/hardware_lottery_hooker.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;hardware lottery&amp;rdquo; is when a research idea succeeds because it is suitable with available hardware.
What does this mean for the future of research?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/books/calling_bullshit.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The world is awash with bullshit,&amp;rdquo; Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West write.
What is it? How do we recognize it? How do we call it out when we see it?
&lt;em&gt;Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World&lt;/em&gt;, informs us on these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Hidden Figures: Roles and Pathways of Successful OSS Contributors</title>
      <link>/papers/hidden_figures_oss_trinkenreich.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/hidden_figures_oss_trinkenreich.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This CSCW paper studies open source software contributors—all of them, not just maintainers and developers. While open source has often been looked at as a purely technical community, this paper draws attention to the other forms of work that contributors do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
