      <description>&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 situation in Illinois is dire. The media doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be talking about it, even though the situation is presently worse here than it was in many places over the summer. What gives?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My review of Nir Eyal&#39;s Hooked</title>

      <guid>/books/hooked.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I review Nir Eyal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Hooked&lt;/em&gt;, a 200-page manual for creating habit-forming products. It&amp;rsquo;s clear that his steps work&amp;mdash;examples from several common products readily support them. But I question whether this is being used for good or evil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory as Sociotechnical Foresight in Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>/papers/decolonial_ai_mohamed.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/decolonial_ai_mohamed.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that AI can be harmful, but discussions of AI harm often miss historical context. This paper explores the role of decolonial theories in AI to address this gap.  Through ethical foresight, the authors argue, we can rethink the role of AI in helping and harming people of different societies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] The Complementary Nature of Perceived and Actual Time Spent Online in Measuring Digital Well-being</title>
      <link>/papers/complementary_nature_time_online_mok.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/complementary_nature_time_online_mok.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Self-reported measures of time spent online are known to be inaccurate compared to objective, server-log-informed measures. And while they&amp;rsquo;re each individually useful in predicting problematic effects online, little is known about how these two measures can be used alongside each other. This CSCW paper uses the open-source, open-data platform Lichess to study this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;hardware lottery&amp;rdquo; is when a research idea succeeds because it is suitable with available hardware.

      <guid>/books/calling_bullshit.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The world is awash with bullshit,&amp;rdquo; Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West write.
What is it? How do we recognize it? How do we call it out when we see it?
&lt;em&gt;Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World&lt;/em&gt;, informs us on these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Hidden Figures: Roles and Pathways of Successful OSS Contributors</title>
      <link>/papers/hidden_figures_oss_trinkenreich.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/hidden_figures_oss_trinkenreich.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This CSCW paper studies open source software contributorsâ€”all of them, not just maintainers and developers. While open source has often been looked at as a purely technical community, this paper draws attention to the other forms of work that contributors do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/mitigating_exploitations_indie_dev_freeman.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a totally different direction from the last two CSCW papers, this work studies the indie game development industry.

      <title>[Paper] Conformity of Eating Disorders through Content Moderation</title>
      <link>/papers/conformity_eating_disorders_piper.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/conformity_eating_disorders_piper.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content moderation is an essential part of online communities, but the experiences of people who are moderated are less studied. This work conducts a digital ethnography on people with eating disorders. The authors argue that moderation enforces conformity on a platform, which can further marginalize people with eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
