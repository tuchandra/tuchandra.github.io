      <guid>/spark/2020/generalized_seir_models.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SEIR models for epidemiology break down a population into four partitions: susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered. This talk gives an overview of how &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ryansmcgee/seirsplus&#34;&gt;seirsplus&lt;/a&gt; can be used with MLflow and hyperopt to run simulations and experiments of possible COVID-19 scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Automated Testing For Protecting Data Pipelines from Undocumented Assumptions</title>
      <link>/spark/2020/automated_testing_undocumented_assumptions.html</link>

      <guid>/spark/2020/automated_testing_undocumented_assumptions.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data pipelines are fraught with undocumented assumptions: about column data types, nullability, acceptable values, and more. Automated unit testing often fails to catch violations of these assumptions. The speakers from Superconductive introduce &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations&#34;&gt;Great Expectations&lt;/a&gt;, a library to build these assumptions into a data pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Measuring User Influence on Twitter: The Million Follower Fallacy</title>
      <link>/papers/measuring_user_influence_twitter_cha.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/measuring_user_influence_twitter_cha.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This 2010 paper recently won the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/icwsm/status/1272747094554574848&#34;&gt;ICWSM Test of Time award&lt;/a&gt;, so I gave it a look. One of the earliest papers studying Twitter, key findings include that followers are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a measure of engagement (but retweets and mentions are), and that influential users are influential about diverse and unrelated topics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to use technology more mindfully, and in particular be more mindful about how I use my phone. I&amp;rsquo;m now trying to have an intention when I pick up my phone, instead of unlocking it and instinctively opening Chrome to hop on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/north-america-2020&#34;&gt;Spark + AI Summit&lt;/a&gt; is happening virtually next week, and I will be spending the second half of next week watching talks from there. I went through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/north-america-2020/agenda&#34;&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt; to make a preliminary list of the talks that sound interesting to me. And just like &lt;a href=&#34;/spark/spark_overview.html&#34;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about them here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
