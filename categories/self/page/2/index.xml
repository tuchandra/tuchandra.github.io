      <title>[Paper] Towards Fine-grained Flow Forecasting: a Graph Attention Approach for Bike Sharing Systems</title>
      <link>/papers/graph_attention_bike_sharing_he.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/graph_attention_bike_sharing_he.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In bike sharing systems, forecasting the demand for pick-ups and drop-offs at each station is essential. This paper presents a novel methodology for doing this, which uses graph neural networks and a spatiotemporal design for station-by-station flow forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What kinds of challenges arise when communicating election forecasts, as FiveThirtyEight, The Economist, and a host of others are attempting to do? How do you best discuss your predictions and uncertainty? What responsibilities do forecasters have? Andrew Gelman, Jessica Hullman, and Christopher Wlezien discuss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I review Nir Eyal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Indistractable&lt;/em&gt;, a quick read that took me less than a week. I found valuable advice for improving my concentration and attention, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to apply some of these ideas to my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My final thoughts on Cass Sunstein&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;#republic&lt;/em&gt;. I talk about what it means to reimagine today&amp;rsquo;s republic, and how Sunstein&amp;rsquo;s book encourages us to rethink the relationship between technology and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Early thoughts from Indistractable</title>
      <link>/books/indistractable_1.html</link>

      <guid>/books/indistractable_1.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My next book is &lt;em&gt;Indistractable&lt;/em&gt; by Nir Eyal. The book&amp;rsquo;s tagline is &amp;ldquo;how to control your attention and choose your life,&amp;rdquo; which is compelling! My early thoughts are mixed between grateful and skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] A Framework for Understanding Unintended Consequences of Machine Learning</title>
      <link>/papers/framework_unintended_consequences_guttag.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/framework_unintended_consequences_guttag.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does it really mean for a machine learning system to be &amp;ldquo;biased&amp;rdquo;? Lots of different things, potentially, to the point where the term being so overloaded has started causing confusion. This paper presents six different categories of bias in machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On speech</title>
      <link>/books/republic_4.html</link>

      <guid>/books/republic_4.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of &lt;em&gt;#republic&lt;/em&gt;, we study speech and its regulation by government. What are reasonable limits that a government might pose on speech? How might these change in the digital era?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Consumers and citzens</title>

      <guid>/books/republic_3.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the recurring themes in Sunstein&amp;rsquo;s book is on the conflict between consumer sovereignty and political sovereignty. The roles of citizen and consumer are different, and we each play both. This post explores this idea a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/books/republic_2.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How is the internet changing shared experiences? What happens when people are walled off from each other more than they were before? This post explores how the internet is contributing to fewer shared experiences, and how this can occasionally be in conflict with democratic ideals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does democracy look like in the age of social media? How do we reimagine public spaces for the digital era? What kinds of groups should the internet promote? These are questions posed by Cass Sunstein&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;em&gt;#republic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, Facebook simulates itself. Through legions of bots trained through reinforcement learning, but running on the real Facebook platform, Facebook details how it created a web-enabled simulation system of its own platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My last week of vacation. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Cass Sunstein&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691175515/republic&#34;&gt;#republic&lt;/a&gt; and the usual stuff from newsletters and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>/papers/equality_of_opportunity_srebro.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/equality_of_opportunity_srebro.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Measuring the (un)fairness of a predictive model is challenging work. This NeurIPS paper motivates and defines two concepts for this, &amp;ldquo;equalized odds&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;equal opportunity.&amp;rdquo; It then develops a a post-training framework to induce these new notions of fairness onto a trained model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did a lot of reading this week&amp;mdash;articles shared on Twitter, from newsletters, or passed along by friends. Topics include AI bias, data science careers, technical debt and testing data science systems, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I picked up &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JanelleCShane&#34;&gt;Janelle Shane&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; book, &lt;em&gt;You Look Like a Thing and I Love You&lt;/em&gt;, a couple of weeks ago. Combining clear explanations of AI with hilarious examples of how weird it can be, this was one of the best books I&amp;rsquo;ve read in a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Content moderation, AI, and the question of scale</title>
      <link>/papers/content_moderation_scale_gillespie.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/content_moderation_scale_gillespie.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This short paper in &lt;em&gt;Big Data and Society&lt;/em&gt; came across my radar on Twitter today. Automated content moderation is often heralded as an answer to the impenetrable size of Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms. But it&amp;rsquo;s not clear that automation is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apple News is used by 85 million users daily, but what is it actually showing you? From what publishers do the stories come? How often are they updated? This ICWSM 2020 paper motivates and applies an algorithmic audit of the Apple News curation system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
