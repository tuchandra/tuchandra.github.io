      <description>I love flying. There&amp;rsquo;s something about the act of being alone with my thoughts that forces introspection and self-awareness, and this post is about what I learned this time.</description>

      <title>[Paper] A Comparison of Approaches to Advertising Measurement: Evidence from Big Field Experiments at Facebook</title>
      <link>/papers/facebook_advertising_field_study_gordon.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/facebook_advertising_field_study_gordon.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In what is probably my last digital advertising paper for now, I read a paper out of Kellogg + Facebook studying the causal effects of digital advertising. This is the nail in the coffin of my belief that digital advertising is overhyped and overvalued, and that they do far less than anyone appears to believe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/posts/iowa_caucus_disaster.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many on Monday, I left work eagerly awaiting the results of the Iowa caucuses happening one state west of me. I got home, cooked dinner, and opened up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/iowa-caucus-2020-election-live/&#34;&gt;FiveThirtyEight live blog&lt;/a&gt; to start following election results. A couple of hours passed, and it became increasingly clear that something had gone very, very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three article summaries, which I&amp;rsquo;m breaking out from my usual &amp;ldquo;what I read&amp;rdquo; posts because of the common theme (of CS research &amp;amp; grad school) that connects them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of hearing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.michaelgreenstone.com/&#34;&gt;Michael Greenstone&lt;/a&gt;, former Chief Economist to President Obama and now professor at UChicago, speak about the Global Energy Challenge. These are my notes and my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/contrasting_social_support_chancellor.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My last of Dr. Chancellor&amp;rsquo;s papers for now. This paper studies the discourse within two online health communities for weight loss, /r/loseit and (the now banned) /r/proED. The authors discuss how different communities provide support differently and discuss design implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/classification_pro_ed_chancellor.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another social computing paper that develops a deep learning classifier for pro-eating disorder content on Tumblr. This work bridges the gap between deep learning and social computing, contributing an image+text classifier for identifying deviant posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/site_comparison.html&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I compared the features of my old and new site. This is part 2 of that post, focusing on things that I missed then that have only come up after a few weeks of using the site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good software engineering is an indispensible part of good data science. I&amp;rsquo;ve believed this for a while, but only recently come to feel strongly about it, and this post goes into more detail on why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/removed_pro_ed_chancellor.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a social computing paper analyzing characteristics of over 30,000 pro-eating disorder (pro-ED) posts that were removed from Instagram after having been public at one time. The authors built a classifier for removed pro-ED posts against non-removed ones, and also studied the characteristics of removed posts more generally. Published in CHI 2016.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I migrated my site a couple of days ago. What are some of the differences, both feature-wise and visually? I&amp;rsquo;ll compare common actions on both.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/competition_crowd_out_simonov.html</guid>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a paper evaluating the effects of the infamous eBay online advertising experiment, in which eBay pulled millions of dollars of own-brand advertising and saw no measurable effect on web traffic. The study (using data from Bing) evaluated how other companies reacted to this news.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
