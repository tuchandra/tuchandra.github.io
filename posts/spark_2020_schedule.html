<p><a href="https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/north-america-2020">Spark + AI Summit</a> is happening virtually next week, and I will be spending the second half of next week watching talks from there. I went through the <a href="https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/north-america-2020/agenda">schedule</a> to make a preliminary list of the talks that sound interesting to me. And just like <a href="/spark/spark_overview.html">last year</a>, I&rsquo;ll be writing about them here.</p>
<h2 id="my-interests-what-im-filtering-for">My interests (what I&rsquo;m filtering for)</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that all of these talks will provide value to someone out there; but I obviously can&rsquo;t watch them all, nor do I want to! I&rsquo;m looking out for (1) talks that might be interesting to me, (2) talks that might be useful to my organization in data science (broadly, researchers developing new methodologies), and (3) talks that might be useful to my company (large and very enterprise-y, but committed to Spark).</p>
<p>This means there are a few kinds of things I&rsquo;m not interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;how our company transitioned to Spark&rdquo; talks, because I&rsquo;m not in a position where that&rsquo;s relevant to me, and we&rsquo;re already heavily invested in Spark</li>
<li>A lot of technical deep-dives (e.g., about Spark internals), which go over my head</li>
<li>Spark + &lt;other tool&gt;, like Delta Lake, HorovodRunner, other Apache software, or Kubernetes, which are usually too specialized for me</li>
<li>Some adjacent fields (security, data engineering and warehouseing, streaming, etc.), which I&rsquo;m typically not interested in</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though Spark Summit will be virtual, it&rsquo;s still easy to get burnt out at conferences. This one has hundreds of talks over three days, and realistically I&rsquo;m probably not going to watch more than four or five each day besides the keynotes.</p>
<p>What follows is my pared-down list of the <a href="https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit/north-america-2020/agenda">full talks schedule</a>. I&rsquo;m definitely interested in other suggestions, though, so feel free to send them to <a href="mailto:me@tusharc.dev">me@tusharc.dev</a>.</p>
<p>One final note: <strong>all times listed are in CDT,</strong> since I&rsquo;m in Chicago. The talks website lists everything in PDT, and a lot of my colleagues are in New York, so convert accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="wednesday-june-24">Wednesday, June 24</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://databricks.com/session_na20/wednesday-morning-keynotes">morning keynotes</a> (10:30 AM - 12:30 PM CDT) are probably worth watching:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Realizing the vision of the data lakehouse</em> by Ali Ghodsi (CEO and co-founder of Databricks)</li>
<li><em>Introducing Apache Spark 3.0: A retrospective of the last 10 years, and a look forward to the next 10 years to come</em> by Matei Zaharia (creator of Spark) and Brooke Wenig (ML Practice Lead at Databricks)</li>
<li><em>How Starbucks is achieving its ‘Enterprise Data Mission’ to enable data and ML at scale and provide world-class customer experiences</em> by Vishwanath Subramanian (director of data &amp; analytics engineering at Starbucks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some interesting-looking talks from the first half of the day:</p>

<p>Then there are the <a href="https://databricks.com/session_na20/wednesday-afternoon-keynotes">afternoon keynotes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Racism and policing: the path forward</em> by Dr. Phillip Atiba Goff from the Center for Policing Equity</li>
<li><em>Science vs Covid, lessons from Covid19Primer.com</em> by Amy Heineike, an author and professor at Loyola</li>
<li><em>The Signal and the Noise: the Big Lessons from 20 years of Data Analysis</em> by Nate Silver from FiveThirtyEight</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these have descriptions (?), and I&rsquo;m not really sure what the first two have to do with Spark or AI, but I&rsquo;m interested in hearing about them regardless. There are more talks that follow these keynotes&mdash;</p>

    <td>I chose this because it sounds like a fun problem; how does LinkedIn generate recommendations for nearly 700 million users to follow any of 10s of millions of entities? They developed a new join algorithm that reduces shuffling and talk about its impact on downstream metrics.</td>
