<p><strong>Author</strong>: Thomas Huijskens</p>
<p><strong>How I found this</strong>: linked in a separate <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/kedro-prepare-to-pimp-your-pipeline-f8f68c263466">blog post</a> by QuantumBlack that I was reading as part of interview prep</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: the author posits that production code is any code that feeds a business process. This includes ad-hoc analyses that inform financial decisions, reports that are automated and sent out weekly, and (most commonly understood as &ldquo;production code&rdquo;) modeling pipelines. Code is a main product or byproduct of a data scientist&rsquo;s work, and so its quality is paramount. The post goes on to include recommendations for writing good code, which I encourage anyone interested to read for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: this is a more extreme version of what I wrote in <a href="/posts/software_in_dsci.html">Software Engineering is an Essential Part of Data Science</a>, and I wholeheartedly agree. I&rsquo;d never thought of ad-hoc analyses as production code, but extending that definition to anything that <em>might</em> need repeating seems prudent. Having a &ldquo;software-first&rdquo; mindset is critical to being an effective data scientist.</p>
<h2 id="kedro-a-new-tool-for-data-sciencehttpstowardsdatasciencecomkedro-prepare-to-pimp-your-pipeline-f8f68c263466"><a class="not-rich" href="#kedro-a-new-tool-for-data-sciencehttpstowardsdatasciencecomkedro-prepare-to-pimp-your-pipeline-f8f68c263466"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/kedro-prepare-to-pimp-your-pipeline-f8f68c263466">Kedro: A new tool for data science</a></h2>
<p><strong>Author</strong>: Jo Stichbury</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: this is a blog post introducing Kedro, a data science workflow tool to facilitate pipeline creation. It helps code to be more easily reproducible, modular, and well-documented. It is not a workflow scheduler, and it <a href="https://medium.com/@QuantumBlack/deploying-and-versioning-data-pipelines-at-scale-942b1d81b5f5">can work</a> alongside something like MLflow; Kedro provides the architecture and structure, and MLflow provides the tracking framework. The post continues with a basic usage tutorial.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: I&rsquo;m getting a little exhausted with all the libraries claiming to be the missing puzzle piece in the data science workflow. Tons of companies have built their own data science platforms (see: Uber&rsquo;s Michelangelo, Facebook&rsquo;s FBLearner Flow, Nielsen&rsquo;s Intelligence Studio and Uni, and who knows how many others). But QB claims to have used this on 60+ projects before open-sourcing it, so I have hope about its robustness.</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues">Github issues</a>, I appreciate the uncommon strategy of proactively seeking user input with <a href="https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues/208">&ldquo;how do you feel &hellip;&quot;</a> questions. The repo appears to be maintained, though the project hasn&rsquo;t existed for very long, and the maintainers seem to be receptive to public feedback. That checks most of my open source hygiene boxes.</p>

<p><strong>Author</strong>: Thomas Essl</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: this post talks about the virtues of design thinking in a data science context. The design team <em>started</em> with the questions &ldquo;what is the true underlying problem&rdquo; and &ldquo;whose problem is it&rdquo; before looking at any data (worried that this may bias or limit their thinking). Starting with this enables you to use data as a constraint and as an enabler, driving research forward while helping you to understand what might or might not be achieved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When searching for an answer to a data-focused question, we are obligated to first make sure the question is the right one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author continues: uncover human stories in data by thinking of each row in terms of the person(s) it represents, and pay special attention to the data you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> have (this in particular can help inform a broader strategy).</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: I love design thinking, and I&rsquo;m really grateful to Northwestern Engineering for <a href="https://design.northwestern.edu/programs/take-design-course/design-thinking-communication/">helping (read: requiring) me</a> to learn it. Going from building models to designing solutions is, to me, an important step in a data scientist&rsquo;s development, and it&rsquo;s a step that I think I have begun taking in my current work. This post fits perfectly in the &ldquo;human-centered data science&rdquo; box within my interests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is therefore vital to build models with the user’s context and needs&mdash;their human story&mdash;to the front of mind. The work of an outcome-focused analytics team does not finish once a model is delivered&mdash;it must be proved to work, adopted by the user and optimised depending on how it is deployed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this. Data science doesn&rsquo;t start with a dataset; it starts with the people or events behind the dataset, and it must consider what data is there and what isn&rsquo;t (and why). Likewise, it doesn&rsquo;t end with a model; it ends with the people your work affects, and the impacts that it has on them. This is what I care about&mdash;how data science, machine learning, and complex technical systems affect real people.</p>

<p><strong>Author</strong>: G. Elliott Morris</p>
<p><strong>How I found this</strong>: my friend and former coworker, <a href="https://judahgnewman.com/about/">Judah</a></p>
<p>This piece appears to be a criticism of another analyst (or, perhaps, pundit) which morphs into general election forecasting advice. The biggest issues with novice election forecasters, Morris claims, is that they <strong>fail to think probabilistically</strong>. This doesn&rsquo;t mean not reporting uncertainty or speaking in terms of point estimates (though I&rsquo;ve seen that happen), but rather failing to account for the possibility of systematic error, treating 80+% as &ldquo;very likely,&rdquo; or talking about things that &ldquo;will&rdquo; or &ldquo;won&rsquo;t&rdquo; happen.</p>
<p>Another important component is <strong>aggregating uncertainy</strong>, or figuring out how we jump from state-level forecasts (whose outcomes are correlated) to national results; that&rsquo;s &ldquo;the million dollar question,&rdquo; he writes, but typically we draw correlated random errors and call it a day. Accounting for <strong>known unknowns</strong> is also challenging&mdash;there are errors from misidentifying the size of the electorate or what voter turnout will be. Good forecasts account for these.</p>
<p>This was a good piece by someone who appears to just be getting into election forecasting. Morris wrote about how the Democratic primary is in <a href="https://thecrosstab.substack.com/p/the-2020-primary-is-peak-__-right">uncharted waters</a>, and I largely agree. But I love this thrill, so it&rsquo;s fun to watch.</p>
<h2 id="other-shorter-articles-and-media"><a class="not-rich" href="#other-shorter-articles-and-media"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a> Other, shorter articles (and media)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/the-ethics-of-artificial-intelligence">The ethics of artificial intelligence (podcast)</a> is part of McKinsey&rsquo;s podcast talking about how companies can ethically deploy AI. This is substantially more pragmatic than most AI ethics pieces I read, and I think that was its primary value to me. AI deployment is often a risk management game, the speakers posit, and these risks take many forms: to the creators (financially, reputationally), to the people the models effect, to the public, etc. Likewise, &ldquo;bias&rdquo; has a lot of meanings, but in practice usually means &ldquo;disparate impact,&rdquo; which is well-defined legally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You think about everyone needs to understand a little bit about AI, and they have to understand, &ldquo;How can we deploy this technology in a way that&rsquo;s ethical, in a way that&rsquo;s compliant with regulations?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s true for the entire organization. It might start at the top, but it needs to cascade through the rest of the organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was quite good&mdash;I expected a lot of fluff, but instead found nuanced discussion of complex, overlapping issues. Also, thanks McKinsey for providing a transcript of the podcast!</p>
