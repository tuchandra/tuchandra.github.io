      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/password_tool_1.html&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I discussed what led me to this Pokemon Mystery Dungeon password project. This post dive into my first attempt at creating something real, followed by an unexpected turn into building a web app.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHI 2020 was supposed to be happening right now, but it was regrettably &lt;a href=&#34;https://chi2020.acm.org/&#34;&gt;cancelled&lt;/a&gt; due to coronavirus. All of the papers were put into the ACM Digital Library as scheduled, though, so I started looking at them. This paper studies data literacy among student-athletes at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this series of blog posts, I&amp;rsquo;ll be covering my newest personal project: a tool for the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon video games that help to make sense of otherwise-uninterpretable passwords. This post covers my motivation for the project and the choice of technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t read much this week, due to a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on that I&amp;rsquo;ll write more about soon. One evening, I sat down to work through a couple things that popped up, thoguh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/acm_fat2020_talks.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I sat down to watch a handful of talks from ACM FAT* 2020, picked from a survey of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://facctconference.org/2020/acceptedpapers.html#sess1&#34;&gt;Accepted Papers&lt;/a&gt; list. I found this to be a good way to consume a variety of papers that I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have ordinarily read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does YouTube drive people to more extreme content? This is a question that many have posed, but this is the first paper to study this question in depth. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this on my reading list since I came across it on Twitter, so this Saturday I finally sat down to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s reading happened almost all in one day, when I took time off work to recharge. I read articles and blog posts on COVID-19 models, focusing on the question of what it means to model something. There are also a couple of garden variety engineering &amp;amp; data science posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another &amp;ldquo;interpeting machine learning&amp;rdquo; paper, this time in a medical context. The Duke researchers propose a &amp;ldquo;model facts&amp;rdquo; label, a la &amp;ldquo;nutrition facts&amp;rdquo; that we see on food packaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I noticed myself doing something I&amp;rsquo;ve done many times before: running into an error, Googling it, finding code snippets, and making random changes in hopes that they&amp;rsquo;d work. In this post, I try to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It took a month of remote work for me to fully abandon the expectation that I should be as productive as usual during this time. This post reflects on why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had some more abstract thoughts about what &amp;ldquo;data science&amp;rdquo; really means while reading &lt;em&gt;Everybody Lies&lt;/em&gt;. In this post, I talk about data science as &lt;em&gt;discovery&lt;/em&gt; and about what it means to &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; data science.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A group of data scientists in my office decided to start a (now virtual) book club; our first book is &lt;em&gt;Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us about Who We Really Are&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethsd.com/everybodylies&#34;&gt;Seth Stephens-Davidowitz&lt;/a&gt;. In this book, the Google data scientist turned NYT writer talks about what we can learn from &amp;ldquo;Big Data&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and why the results might be surprising.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, I read two articles about &amp;ldquo;broader impact&amp;rdquo; statements, soon to be required by NeurIPS. Other articles include a discussion of Facebook&amp;rsquo;s suicide prevention AI, suggestions on fighting fake news, and poll results showing Fox News viewers are less likely to take the coronavirus threat seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This new paper by Drs. Chancellor and De Choudhury is a literature review of predicting mental health states from social media, studying in particular the extent to which the papers report their methods in sufficient depth and clarity. They propose reporting standards for publications in this space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my response to an article from Wired, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/why-dont-we-just-ban-targeted-advertising/&#34;&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t we just ban targeted advertising?&lt;/a&gt;. My direct answer is &amp;ldquo;because that&amp;rsquo;s not the problem,&amp;rdquo; and I instead discuss the two more fundamental problems that I see in that space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
