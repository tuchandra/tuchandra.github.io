      <description>&lt;p&gt;How are MMORPGs perceived by people with social anxiety? What do they find enjoyable about MMORPGS? How does real-world anxiety translate to social experiences in a video game setting? This CHI 2020 paper by Dechant et al. studies these and other questions about the interactions between social anxiety and video games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Random, Messy, Funny, Raw: Finstas as Intimate Reconfigurations of Social Media</title>
      <link>/papers/intimate_reconfigurations_finsta_xiao.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/intimate_reconfigurations_finsta_xiao.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another paper studying &amp;ldquo;finstas&amp;rdquo; (fake / secret Instagram accounts, shared only with a small group of people). This one, by Sijia Xiao et al., received an Honorable Mention at CHI 2020. In contrast to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s, this work draws from feminist theory to explore finstas as &amp;ldquo;intimate reconfigurations&amp;rdquo; of the Instagram platform itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday morning, I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chinordic2020.org/&#34;&gt;CHI Nordic 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which was a mini-conference put together to present and discuss Nordic papers from CHI 2020. I joined the last session on &amp;ldquo;computational materials&amp;rdquo; and watched 3 talks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHI 2020 was supposed to be happening right now, but it was regrettably &lt;a href=&#34;https://chi2020.acm.org/&#34;&gt;cancelled&lt;/a&gt; due to coronavirus. All of the papers were put into the ACM Digital Library as scheduled, though, so I started looking at them. This paper studies data literacy among student-athletes at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t read much this week, due to a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on that I&amp;rsquo;ll write more about soon. One evening, I sat down to work through a couple things that popped up, thoguh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/acm_fat2020_talks.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I sat down to watch a handful of talks from ACM FAT* 2020, picked from a survey of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://facctconference.org/2020/acceptedpapers.html#sess1&#34;&gt;Accepted Papers&lt;/a&gt; list. I found this to be a good way to consume a variety of papers that I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have ordinarily read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/auditing_radicalization_youtube_ribeiro.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does YouTube drive people to more extreme content? This is a question that many have posed, but this is the first paper to study this question in depth. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this on my reading list since I came across it on Twitter, so this Saturday I finally sat down to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s reading happened almost all in one day, when I took time off work to recharge. I read articles and blog posts on COVID-19 models, focusing on the question of what it means to model something. There are also a couple of garden variety engineering &amp;amp; data science posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I noticed myself doing something I&amp;rsquo;ve done many times before: running into an error, Googling it, finding code snippets, and making random changes in hopes that they&amp;rsquo;d work. In this post, I try to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It took a month of remote work for me to fully abandon the expectation that I should be as productive as usual during this time. This post reflects on why.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
