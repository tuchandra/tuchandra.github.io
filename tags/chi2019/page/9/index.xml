      <title>Is Twitter real life?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought, and read, a lot about the extent to which Twitter is a good signal of what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the world&amp;mdash;colloquially, the phrase being thrown around is &amp;ldquo;Twitter (is / isn&amp;rsquo;t) real life.&amp;rdquo; Much like Twitter itself, this question oversimplifies things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to read much this week, but I also decided to split up my weekly reading posts into the &lt;a href=&#34;/what_i_read/20200314.html&#34;&gt;usual one&lt;/a&gt; and this one, summarizing coronavirus-related pieces I&amp;rsquo;ve read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many, coronavirus-related things have been taking over my life; in the first few days of working fully remotely, I struggled to find an appropriate work-life balance. This resulted in me reading less than usual, which is reflected in this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! This week&amp;rsquo;s reading was a lot of Morning Paper articles, AI skepticism from a VC firm, and posts from /r/MachineLearning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My work Macbook had to be sent in for repair, and the hard drive got wiped. I documented all the steps I took to set it up again. You can use this as a starting point for setting up a new machine, and so can I if I need to do this again soon!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/books/network_propaganda_1.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/cant_not_be_researcher.html&#34;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; that I was reading the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001/oso-9780190923624&#34;&gt;Network Propaganda&lt;/a&gt; by Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris, and Hal Roberts. I believe I&amp;rsquo;ll get more from the book if I write about it, &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/why_papers.html&#34;&gt;as with papers&lt;/a&gt;, so I plan to write up a summary and thoughts on each of four parts of the book. The entire book is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001/oso-9780190923624&#34;&gt;for free online&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/posts/openai_unease.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Early last week, an article was posted at the MIT Technology Review: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615181/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/&#34;&gt;the messy, secretive reality behind OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s bid to save the world&lt;/a&gt; by Karen Hao. As well-written as it is long, I started thinking about what OpenAI stands for and why it makes me increasingly uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Section 230, the internet, and neutrality</title>

      <guid>/posts/section_230_and_neutrality.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects publishers of third-party content, is the foundation of the modern internet. Recent debate has focused on algorithmic curation and content moderation, but this misses the heart of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper characterizes and studies the migration of fringe &amp;ldquo;men&amp;rsquo;s rights&amp;rdquo; groups on Reddit and elsewhere.

      <title>[Paper] Watching You Watch: The Tracking Ecosystem of Over-the-Top TV Streaming Devices</title>

      <guid>/papers/ott_tracking_moghaddam.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper studies the tracking ecosystem of Roku and Amazon Fire devices, discovering that channels on both platforms regularly send their traffic to known trackers. They also note that they often transmit unique identifiers, and that known methods to protect privacy are largely ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I love flying. There&amp;rsquo;s something about the act of being alone with my thoughts that forces introspection and self-awareness, and this post is about what I learned this time.</description>

      <title>[Paper] A Comparison of Approaches to Advertising Measurement: Evidence from Big Field Experiments at Facebook</title>
      <link>/papers/facebook_advertising_field_study_gordon.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/facebook_advertising_field_study_gordon.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In what is probably my last digital advertising paper for now, I read a paper out of Kellogg + Facebook studying the causal effects of digital advertising. This is the nail in the coffin of my belief that digital advertising is overhyped and overvalued, and that they do far less than anyone appears to believe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many on Monday, I left work eagerly awaiting the results of the Iowa caucuses happening one state west of me. I got home, cooked dinner, and opened up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/iowa-caucus-2020-election-live/&#34;&gt;FiveThirtyEight live blog&lt;/a&gt; to start following election results. A couple of hours passed, and it became increasingly clear that something had gone very, very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three article summaries, which I&amp;rsquo;m breaking out from my usual &amp;ldquo;what I read&amp;rdquo; posts because of the common theme (of CS research &amp;amp; grad school) that connects them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
