      <title>[Paper] Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory as Sociotechnical Foresight in Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>/papers/decolonial_ai_mohamed.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that AI can be harmful, but discussions of AI harm often miss historical context. This paper explores the role of decolonial theories in AI to address this gap.  Through ethical foresight, the authors argue, we can rethink the role of AI in helping and harming people of different societies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] The Complementary Nature of Perceived and Actual Time Spent Online in Measuring Digital Well-being</title>
      <link>/papers/complementary_nature_time_online_mok.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/complementary_nature_time_online_mok.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Self-reported measures of time spent online are known to be inaccurate compared to objective, server-log-informed measures. And while they&amp;rsquo;re each individually useful in predicting problematic effects online, little is known about how these two measures can be used alongside each other. This CSCW paper uses the open-source, open-data platform Lichess to study this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;hardware lottery&amp;rdquo; is when a research idea succeeds because it is suitable with available hardware.
What does this mean for the future of research?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/books/calling_bullshit.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The world is awash with bullshit,&amp;rdquo; Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West write.
What is it? How do we recognize it? How do we call it out when we see it?
&lt;em&gt;Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World&lt;/em&gt;, informs us on these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/hidden_figures_oss_trinkenreich.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This CSCW paper studies open source software contributorsâ€”all of them, not just maintainers and developers. While open source has often been looked at as a purely technical community, this paper draws attention to the other forms of work that contributors do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Mitigating Exploitation: Indie Game Developers&#39; Reconfigurations of Labor in Technology</title>
      <link>/papers/mitigating_exploitations_indie_dev_freeman.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/mitigating_exploitations_indie_dev_freeman.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a totally different direction from the last two CSCW papers, this work studies the indie game development industry. How does the indie community reconfigure labor in their own image? This paper explores these questions in the context of labor and technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Conformity of Eating Disorders through Content Moderation</title>
      <link>/papers/conformity_eating_disorders_piper.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/conformity_eating_disorders_piper.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content moderation is an essential part of online communities, but the experiences of people who are moderated are less studied. This work conducts a digital ethnography on people with eating disorders. The authors argue that moderation enforces conformity on a platform, which can further marginalize people with eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/election_predicting_twitter_gayoavello.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Affectionately titled &amp;ldquo;I wanted to predict elections with Twitter and all I got was this lousy paper.&amp;rdquo;
This survey paper chronicles various attempts to predict elections from Twitter, and finds that (surprise!) its predictive power has been greatly exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Evaluating the fake news problem at the scale of the information ecosystem</title>
      <link>/papers/fake_news_information_ecosystem_watts.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/fake_news_information_ecosystem_watts.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the role of fake news in the overall media ecosystem?
Conventional wisdom might say it&amp;rsquo;s significant, but this paper provides evidence for the opposite.
Using datasets of cross-platform media viewing, the authors find that fake news represents a small proportion of overall media consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Deconstructing the Filter Bubble: User Decision-Making and Recommender Systems</title>

      <guid>/papers/deconstructing_filter_bubble_aridor.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising research findings is that filter bubbles arise even in the absence of recommendation.
How does this happen, and what can be done to alleviate it?
This RecSys 2020 paper investigates by modeling recommender systems with numerical simulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
