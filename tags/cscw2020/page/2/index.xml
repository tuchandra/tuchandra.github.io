      <link>/papers/hidden_figures_oss_trinkenreich.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/hidden_figures_oss_trinkenreich.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This CSCW paper studies open source software contributorsâ€”all of them, not just maintainers and developers. While open source has often been looked at as a purely technical community, this paper draws attention to the other forms of work that contributors do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Mitigating Exploitation: Indie Game Developers&#39; Reconfigurations of Labor in Technology</title>
      <link>/papers/mitigating_exploitations_indie_dev_freeman.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/mitigating_exploitations_indie_dev_freeman.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a totally different direction from the last two CSCW papers, this work studies the indie game development industry. How does the indie community reconfigure labor in their own image? This paper explores these questions in the context of labor and technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Conformity of Eating Disorders through Content Moderation</title>
      <link>/papers/conformity_eating_disorders_piper.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/conformity_eating_disorders_piper.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content moderation is an essential part of online communities, but the experiences of people who are moderated are less studied. This work conducts a digital ethnography on people with eating disorders. The authors argue that moderation enforces conformity on a platform, which can further marginalize people with eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cscw.acm.org/2020/&#34;&gt;CSCW 2020&lt;/a&gt; (on &amp;ldquo;computer-supported cooperative work and social computing&amp;rdquo;) is running from October 17th to 21st. While I&amp;rsquo;m not attending, I went through the program to look for papers that caught my eye. This post has the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] A balanced survey on election prediction using Twitter data</title>
      <link>/papers/election_predicting_twitter_gayoavello.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/election_predicting_twitter_gayoavello.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Affectionately titled &amp;ldquo;I wanted to predict elections with Twitter and all I got was this lousy paper.&amp;rdquo;
This survey paper chronicles various attempts to predict elections from Twitter, and finds that (surprise!) its predictive power has been greatly exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Evaluating the fake news problem at the scale of the information ecosystem</title>
      <link>/papers/fake_news_information_ecosystem_watts.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/fake_news_information_ecosystem_watts.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the role of fake news in the overall media ecosystem?
Conventional wisdom might say it&amp;rsquo;s significant, but this paper provides evidence for the opposite.
Using datasets of cross-platform media viewing, the authors find that fake news represents a small proportion of overall media consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Deconstructing the Filter Bubble: User Decision-Making and Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>/papers/deconstructing_filter_bubble_aridor.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/deconstructing_filter_bubble_aridor.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising research findings is that filter bubbles arise even in the absence of recommendation.
How does this happen, and what can be done to alleviate it?
This RecSys 2020 paper investigates by modeling recommender systems with numerical simulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s reading: why finishing a personal project is hard, a GPT-3 bot posing as a human, more findings from Cambridge Analytica, and an interview with Safiya Noble.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a companion post to my upcoming PyMCon talk, &lt;em&gt;Learning Bayesian Statistics with Pokemon GO&lt;/em&gt;. I want to catalog resources that helped me to learn Bayesian inference for the benefit of others trying to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My favorite Python 3.9 feature isn&#39;t a 3.9 feature</title>

      <guid>/posts/python_39_generics.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python 3.9 was released this week, and with it come a few incremental features. But my favorite feature isn&amp;rsquo;t just in Python 3.9&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s usable in 3.7 and up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] &#39;Data Strikes&#39;: Evaluating the Effectiveness of a New Form of Collective Action Against Technology Companies</title>

      <guid>/papers/data_strikes_vincent.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do you do when &amp;ldquo;hit a company where it hurts&amp;rdquo; means their data, or their models? What does it mean to go on a &amp;ldquo;data strike&amp;rdquo;? This paper studies the idea of withholding one&amp;rsquo;s personal data and evaluates its impact on  recommender systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/what_i_read/20201003.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week: a multi-armed bandit and a opinion dynamics model, both written in Julia by chance. That sparked a rabbit hole of reading about the language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Improving fairness in machine learning systems: What do industry practitioners need?</title>

      <guid>/papers/improving_fairness_practitioner_needs_holstein.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s lots of research on what (un)fairness in machine learning looks like. But what do industry practitioners actually need to address fairness issues? This paper surveys them to find out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Reliance on Metrics is a Fundamental Challenge for AI</title>
      <link>/papers/reliance_metrics_problem_thomas.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/reliance_metrics_problem_thomas.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my more deeply held beliefs is that people rely too heavily on metrics, so when my friend Judah sent me this paper I was quick to jump on it. Rachel Thomas and David Uminsky argue that an overemphasis on metrics is a fundamental problem with AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
