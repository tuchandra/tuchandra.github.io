      <title>[Paper] A balanced survey on election prediction using Twitter data</title>
      <link>/papers/election_predicting_twitter_gayoavello.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/election_predicting_twitter_gayoavello.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Affectionately titled &amp;ldquo;I wanted to predict elections with Twitter and all I got was this lousy paper.&amp;rdquo;
This survey paper chronicles various attempts to predict elections from Twitter, and finds that (surprise!) its predictive power has been greatly exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Evaluating the fake news problem at the scale of the information ecosystem</title>
      <link>/papers/fake_news_information_ecosystem_watts.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/fake_news_information_ecosystem_watts.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the role of fake news in the overall media ecosystem?
Conventional wisdom might say it&amp;rsquo;s significant, but this paper provides evidence for the opposite.
Using datasets of cross-platform media viewing, the authors find that fake news represents a small proportion of overall media consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Deconstructing the Filter Bubble: User Decision-Making and Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>/papers/deconstructing_filter_bubble_aridor.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/deconstructing_filter_bubble_aridor.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising research findings is that filter bubbles arise even in the absence of recommendation.
How does this happen, and what can be done to alleviate it?
This RecSys 2020 paper investigates by modeling recommender systems with numerical simulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s reading: why finishing a personal project is hard, a GPT-3 bot posing as a human, more findings from Cambridge Analytica, and an interview with Safiya Noble.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a companion post to my upcoming PyMCon talk, &lt;em&gt;Learning Bayesian Statistics with Pokemon GO&lt;/em&gt;. I want to catalog resources that helped me to learn Bayesian inference for the benefit of others trying to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My favorite Python 3.9 feature isn&#39;t a 3.9 feature</title>

      <guid>/posts/python_39_generics.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Python 3.9 was released this week, and with it come a few incremental features. But my favorite feature isn&amp;rsquo;t just in Python 3.9&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s usable in 3.7 and up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] &#39;Data Strikes&#39;: Evaluating the Effectiveness of a New Form of Collective Action Against Technology Companies</title>
      <link>/papers/data_strikes_vincent.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/data_strikes_vincent.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do you do when &amp;ldquo;hit a company where it hurts&amp;rdquo; means their data, or their models? What does it mean to go on a &amp;ldquo;data strike&amp;rdquo;? This paper studies the idea of withholding one&amp;rsquo;s personal data and evaluates its impact on  recommender systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week: a multi-armed bandit and a opinion dynamics model, both written in Julia by chance. That sparked a rabbit hole of reading about the language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Improving fairness in machine learning systems: What do industry practitioners need?</title>

      <guid>/papers/improving_fairness_practitioner_needs_holstein.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s lots of research on what (un)fairness in machine learning looks like. But what do industry practitioners actually need to address fairness issues? This paper surveys them to find out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Reliance on Metrics is a Fundamental Challenge for AI</title>
      <link>/papers/reliance_metrics_problem_thomas.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/reliance_metrics_problem_thomas.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my more deeply held beliefs is that people rely too heavily on metrics, so when my friend Judah sent me this paper I was quick to jump on it. Rachel Thomas and David Uminsky argue that an overemphasis on metrics is a fundamental problem with AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Why ask Why? Forward Causal Inference and Reverse Causal Questions</title>
      <link>/papers/why_ask_why_gelman.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/why_ask_why_gelman.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This short paper argues that reverse causal questions (&amp;ldquo;why did sales go down?&amp;quot;) are opportunities to consider problems with existing models. The search for causal explanations, then, can help us to improve our models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Towards Fine-grained Flow Forecasting: a Graph Attention Approach for Bike Sharing Systems</title>
      <link>/papers/graph_attention_bike_sharing_he.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/graph_attention_bike_sharing_he.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In bike sharing systems, forecasting the demand for pick-ups and drop-offs at each station is essential. This paper presents a novel methodology for doing this, which uses graph neural networks and a spatiotemporal design for station-by-station flow forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What kinds of challenges arise when communicating election forecasts, as FiveThirtyEight, The Economist, and a host of others are attempting to do? How do you best discuss your predictions and uncertainty? What responsibilities do forecasters have? Andrew Gelman, Jessica Hullman, and Christopher Wlezien discuss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I review Nir Eyal&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Indistractable&lt;/em&gt;, a quick read that took me less than a week. I found valuable advice for improving my concentration and attention, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to apply some of these ideas to my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My final thoughts on Cass Sunstein&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;#republic&lt;/em&gt;. I talk about what it means to reimagine today&amp;rsquo;s republic, and how Sunstein&amp;rsquo;s book encourages us to rethink the relationship between technology and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
