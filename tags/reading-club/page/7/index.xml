      <title>Network Propaganda, part 1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/cant_not_be_researcher.html&#34;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; that I was reading the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001/oso-9780190923624&#34;&gt;Network Propaganda&lt;/a&gt; by Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris, and Hal Roberts. I believe I&amp;rsquo;ll get more from the book if I write about it, &lt;a href=&#34;/posts/why_papers.html&#34;&gt;as with papers&lt;/a&gt;, so I plan to write up a summary and thoughts on each of four parts of the book. The entire book is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001/oso-9780190923624&#34;&gt;for free online&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/posts/openai_unease.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Early last week, an article was posted at the MIT Technology Review: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615181/ai-openai-moonshot-elon-musk-sam-altman-greg-brockman-messy-secretive-reality/&#34;&gt;the messy, secretive reality behind OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s bid to save the world&lt;/a&gt; by Karen Hao. As well-written as it is long, I started thinking about what OpenAI stands for and why it makes me increasingly uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/posts/section_230_and_neutrality.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects publishers of third-party content, is the foundation of the modern internet. Recent debate has focused on algorithmic curation and content moderation, but this misses the heart of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper characterizes and studies the migration of fringe &amp;ldquo;men&amp;rsquo;s rights&amp;rdquo; groups on Reddit and elsewhere. They demonstrate that these communities (the &amp;ldquo;Manosphere&amp;rdquo;) has more hateful speech than the rest of the web.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent half an hour watching one of Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI&#34;&gt;deep learning lectures&lt;/a&gt;, this one focusing on reading research papers and career advice. This post is a summary of what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Watching You Watch: The Tracking Ecosystem of Over-the-Top TV Streaming Devices</title>
      <link>/papers/ott_tracking_moghaddam.html</link>

      <guid>/papers/ott_tracking_moghaddam.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper studies the tracking ecosystem of Roku and Amazon Fire devices, discovering that channels on both platforms regularly send their traffic to known trackers. They also note that they often transmit unique identifiers, and that known methods to protect privacy are largely ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I love flying. There&amp;rsquo;s something about the act of being alone with my thoughts that forces introspection and self-awareness, and this post is about what I learned this time.</description>

      <title>[Paper] A Comparison of Approaches to Advertising Measurement: Evidence from Big Field Experiments at Facebook</title>
      <link>/papers/facebook_advertising_field_study_gordon.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/papers/facebook_advertising_field_study_gordon.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In what is probably my last digital advertising paper for now, I read a paper out of Kellogg + Facebook studying the causal effects of digital advertising. This is the nail in the coffin of my belief that digital advertising is overhyped and overvalued, and that they do far less than anyone appears to believe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/posts/iowa_caucus_disaster.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many on Monday, I left work eagerly awaiting the results of the Iowa caucuses happening one state west of me. I got home, cooked dinner, and opened up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/iowa-caucus-2020-election-live/&#34;&gt;FiveThirtyEight live blog&lt;/a&gt; to start following election results. A couple of hours passed, and it became increasingly clear that something had gone very, very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three article summaries, which I&amp;rsquo;m breaking out from my usual &amp;ldquo;what I read&amp;rdquo; posts because of the common theme (of CS research &amp;amp; grad school) that connects them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of hearing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.michaelgreenstone.com/&#34;&gt;Michael Greenstone&lt;/a&gt;, former Chief Economist to President Obama and now professor at UChicago, speak about the Global Energy Challenge. These are my notes and my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Paper] Norms Matter: Contrasting Social Support Around Behavior Change in Online Weight Loss Communities</title>

      <guid>/papers/contrasting_social_support_chancellor.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My last of Dr. Chancellor&amp;rsquo;s papers for now. This paper studies the discourse within two online health communities for weight loss, /r/loseit and (the now banned) /r/proED. The authors discuss how different communities provide support differently and discuss design implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/papers/classification_pro_ed_chancellor.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another social computing paper that develops a deep learning classifier for pro-eating disorder content on Tumblr. This work bridges the gap between deep learning and social computing, contributing an image+text classifier for identifying deviant posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
